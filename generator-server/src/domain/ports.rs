/*
   Module `ports` specifies the API by which external modules interact with the map domain.

   All traits are bounded by `Send + Sync + 'static`, since their implementations must be shareable
   between request-handling threads.

   Trait methods are explicitly asynchronous, including `Send` bounds on response types,
   since the application is expected to always run in a multithreaded environment.
